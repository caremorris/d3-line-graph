A Web-based data visualization of historical temperature data for Cincinnati. The user can select a year and the temperature data is displayed as a line chart. 

The python script "tempoJSON.py" gets the Cincinnati temperature data from the NOAA ftp server and converts it into JSON. It can also insert the data into an SQLite database, creating one if it doesn't exist.
